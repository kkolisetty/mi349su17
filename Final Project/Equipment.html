        <h2>Racket:</h2>

        <h2>Balls:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Balls are pretty much the same with all companies. The only difference in balls is the type of ball. There are balls made for all levels of tennis. Beginners can play with a ball that has a slower bounce speed so it is easier to hit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grips and Dampeners:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Many tennis players play with vibration dampers in their strings. These dampers change the sound when you hit the ball. Some pros play with dampers and other play without. It generally helps so that too much bad pressure isnâ€™t placed on the strings.</li>
            <li>The grip on a tennis racket also comes in different forms. You can either use a leather grip which is what the racket comes with or you play with an over grip. The leather ones are more expensive to replace but they also last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Is is important though to have the right size of grip on your tennis racket. Over grips are generally used to make the racket grip bigger for larger hands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accessories:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some other accessories that you can use are wrist bands, head bands to prevent sweat. You can string savers to prevent strings from breaking too easily.</li>
