<h1>Design Principles</h1>

  <h1>Modularity</h1>
  <img src="Modularity.png" alt="Modularity" />
  <p>Modularity is dividing systems into smaller and self contained systems. Friv.com is divided in many small systems. Each game is it’s own system and is very easy to add more games because everything is so self-contained.

  <h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
  <img src="RuleofThirds.png" alt="RuleofThirds" />
  <p>This the rule that makes websites look aesthetically pleasing. In this website the main photo is places along the right vertical line. And the the texts and buttons are placed on the left line. The main things are placed in the focal points which qualifies it for rule of thirds.

  <h1>80/20 Rule</h1>
  <img src="8020.png" alt="80/20" />
  <p>The 80/20 rule is all targeting the right audience, generally the 20% population that generates the 80% profit. Amazon.com, when adding new addresses gives you a default of United States. This is because majority of the people that give amazon it’s 80% profit is the US and hence they made it their default. </p>

  <h1>Hicks Law</h1>
  <img src="HicksLaw.png" alt="Hicks Law" />
  <p>This law is all about reducing decisions for users on a website. Google.com is an example of this because there are not many options at all for the user to make. They can either search something or sign into their account on the top right hand corner. Hence users are not going to be overwhelmed with the options. </p>

  <h1>S/N Ratio</h1>
  <img src="Ratio.png" alt="S/NRatio" />
  <p>I think that this website is a good example of signal to noise ratio. S/N ratio is all about keeping designs simple and not making people think about what does what on the website. I think pandora.com homepage is a good example of it. It’s very straightforward to use and there isn’t much going on in there. Just a simple search bar to search for any song you want, log in menu on the top and a few top stations to the side. A person doesn’t have to think that much at all to use this website. </p>
